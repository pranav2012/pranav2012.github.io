<h1>About The Page:</h1>

<p> 

Hey! I'm <strong>Pranav</strong>.
This page is all about Cyber Security in which we are going to see<br />
what are diffrent kinds of attacks which risks our privacy or important data <br />
we will see some ways how to stay safe from them and the Precautions we can take.<br />
 some names of the attacks are <i>DDOS attack, SQL injection, Social Engieering,<br />
 Phissing, Brute Force password attacks, etc.</i> the detailed information about <br />
all these are given below with some videos and pictures have been added for further clarity.

</p> 


<h1>what can actually happen to you:</h1>

<img src="media\index.jpg" style = "float: right" />
<p>

While your computer is connected to the Internet, the malware a hacker has installed <br /> 
on your PC quietly transmits your personal and financial information without your knowledge<br />
 or consent. Or, a computer predator may pounce on the private information you unwittingly revealed.<br />
 In either case, they may:


<UL>
   <li> Hijack your usernames and passwords</li>
   <li> Steal your money and open credit card and bank accounts in your name</li>
    <li>Ruin your credit</li>
    <li>Request new account Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) or additional credit cards</li>
    <li>Make purchases</li>
    <li>Add themselves or an alias that they control as an authorized user so it’s easier to use your credit</li>
    <li>Obtain cash advances</li>
    <li>Use and abuse your Social Security number</li>
    <li>Sell your information to other parties who will use it for illicit or illegal purposes</li>
</UL>

Predators can pose a serious physical threat. Use extreme caution when agreeing to meet an online “friend” or acquaintance in person.</p>

<h1>what can you do:</h1>

<img src="media\hi.jpg"style = "float: right"/>
<p>

When you arm yourself with information and resources, you’re wiser about computer security threats<br />
and less vulnerable to threat tactics. Hackers and predators pose equally serious and but very different threats.<br />
To protect your computer from hackers and predators:<br />

    
Continually check the accuracy of personal accounts and deal with any discrepancies right away<br />
Use extreme caution when entering chat rooms or posting personal Web pages<br />
Limit the personal information you post on a personal Web pages<br />
Carefully monitor requests by online “friends” or acquaintances for predatory behavior<br />
Keep personal and financial information out of online conversations<br />
Use extreme caution when agreeing to meet an online “friend” or acquaintance in person<br />


<br /><b>Take these steps to protect your computer from hackers right away:</b><br />


<UL>
     <li>Use a 2 way firewall</li>
     <li>Update your operating system regularly</li>
     <li>Increase your browser security settings</li>
     <li>Avoid questionable Web sites</li>
     <li>Only download software from sites you trust. Carefully evaluate free software and file-sharing applications before downloading them.</li>
     <li>Practice safe email protocol:</li>
     <li>Don't open messages from unknown senders</li>
     <li>Immediately delete messages you suspect to be spam</li>
     <li>Make sure that you have the best security software products installed on your PC:</li>
     <li>Use antivirus protection</li>
     <li>Get antispyware software protection</li>
</UL>

<br />An unprotected computer is like an open door for computer hackers and predators.
To take it a step further, protect your computer<br /> from hackers by using a spam filter or gateway 
to scan inbound email or IM messages.<br /> Products like Webroot Spy Sweeper® and Webroot Internet Security
Essentials thwart dangerous malware before it can enter your PC,<br /> stand guard at every possible entrance of your computer
and fend off any spyware or viruses that try to enter,<br /> even the most damaging and devious strains.
While free anti-spyware and antivirus downloads are available,<br /> they just can’t keep up with the continuous
onslaught of new malware strains.<br /> Previously undetected forms of malware can often do the most damage,
so it’s critical to have up-to-the-minute, guaranteed protection.

<h2><big>Types of Attacks:</big></h2>

<h1>Distributed Denial Of Service(DDoS): attack</h1>

<img src="media\ddos.jpg"style = "float: right"/>
<p>

In a typical DDoS attack, the assailant begins by exploiting a vulnerability in one computer system and making it the DDoS master.<br /> 
The attack master system identifies other vulnerable systems and gains control over them by either infecting the systems with malware<br />
 or through bypassing the authentication controls (i.e., guessing the default password on a widely used system or device).<br />
A computer or networked device under the control of an intruder is known as a zombie, or bot. The attacker creates what is called<br />
 a command-and-control server to command the network of bots, also called a botnet. The person in control of a botnet is sometimes<br />
 referred to as the botmaster (that term has also historically been used to refer to the first system "recruited" into a botnet<br />
 because it is used to control the spread and activity of other systems in the botnet).<br />
Botnets can be comprised of almost any number of bots; botnets with tens or hundreds of thousands of nodes<br />
 have become increasingly common, and there may not be an upper limit to their size. Once the botnet is assembled,<br />
 the attacker can use the traffic generated by the compromised devices to flood the target domain and knock it offline. 


</p>



<h1>Phissing attack:</h1>

<img src="media\fb.jpg"style = "float: right"/>
<p>

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers.<br />
 It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message.<br />
 The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the system<br />
as part of a ransomware attack or the revealing of sensitive information.
An attack can have devastating results.<br /> For individuals, this includes unauthorized purchases, the stealing of funds, or identify theft.
Moreover, phishing is often used<br />
 to gain a foothold in corporate or governmental networks as a part of a larger attack, such as an advanced persistent threat (APT) event.<br />
 In this latter scenario, employees are compromised in order to bypass security perimeters, distribute malware inside a closed environment, <br />
 or gain privileged access to secured data.
An organization succumbing to such an attack typically sustains severe financial losses in addition to declining market share,<br />
reputation, and consumer trust. Depending on scope, a phishing attempt might escalate into a security incident from which<br />
a business will have a difficult time recovering.

</p>



<h1>Social Engineering Attacks:</h1>

<img src="media\se.png"style = "float: right"/>
<p>

Social engineering is the art of manipulating people so they give up confidential information. The types of information these criminals<br />
 are seeking can vary, but when individuals are targeted the criminals are usually trying to trick you into giving them your passwords or bank<br />
information, or access your computer to secretly install malicious software–that will give them access to your passwords and bank information<br />
 as well as giving them control over your computer.
Criminals use social engineering tactics because it is usually easier to exploit<br />
 your natural inclination to trust than it is to discover ways to hack your software.  For example, it is much easier to fool someone into <br />
giving you their password than it is for you to try hacking their password (unless the password is really weak).
Security is all about knowing who and what to trust.<br />
 Knowing when, and when not to, to take a person at their word; when to trust that the person you are communicating with is indeed<br />
the person you think you are communicating with; when to trust that a website is or isn’t legitimate; when to trust that the person on the phone is or<br />
 isn’t legitimate; when providing your information is or isn’t a good idea.
Ask any security professional and they will tell<br />
 you that the weakest link in the security chain is the human who accepts a person or scenario at face value. It doesn’t matter how many locks</br>
 and deadbolts are on your doors and windows, or if have guard dogs, alarm systems, floodlights, fences with barbed wire, and armed security personnel;</br>
 if you trust the person at the gate who says he is the pizza delivery guy and you let him in without first checking to see if he is legitimate you are<br />
 completely exposed to whatever risk he represents.

</p>



<h1>SQL Injection:</h1>

<img src="media\sql.png"style = "float: right"/>
<p>

SQL injection, also known as SQLI, is a common attack vector that uses malicious SQL code for backend database manipulation to access information<br />
 that was not intended to be displayed. This information may include any number of items, including sensitive company data, user lists or private customer details.<br /
The impact SQL injection can have on a business is far reaching. A successful attack may result in the unauthorized viewing of user lists, the deletion of entire tables<br />
 and, in certain cases, the attacker gaining administrative rights to a database, all of which are highly detrimental to a business.
When calculating the potential<br />
 cost of a SQLI, it’s important to consider the loss of customer trust should personal information such as phone numbers, addresses and credit card details be stolen.<br />
While this vector can be used to attack any SQL database, websites are the most frequent targets.

</p>

<h1>Brute Force:</h1>

<img src="media\bf.jpg"style = "float: right"/>
<p>

A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as a user password or personal identification number (PIN).<br />
In a brute force attack, automated software is used to generate a large number of consecutive guesses as to the value of the desired data. <br />
Brute force attacks may be used by criminals to crack encrypted data, or by security analysts to test an organization's network security.<br />
A brute force attack is also known as brute force cracking or simply brute force.
